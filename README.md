- ğŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @anyanwuosi
- ğŸ‘€ Iâ€™m interested in developing cross-platform apps using dart and flutter.
- ğŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning dart. It's my first ever programmming language, I may be a little late to the party but I'm absolutely enjoying myself
- ğŸ“« How to reach me? Just search for @atomspinach on the bird app.
